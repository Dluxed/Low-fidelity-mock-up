# Low-fidelity-mock-up
Design of a shopping application inspired by the universe of resident evil 4
This application was made from the peddler purchase interface of the original resident evil 4, the project being a small reimagination of a menu from the same game, choosing colors and functionalities based on this. The project has the same function, serving as an interactive shopping menu with purchasing and inventory review capabilities through a selection menu. The menus through which you travel are quite intuitive, and to purchase you only need to add the number of items you want to a cart and proceed with the purchase in the upper right part of the purchase menu. The inventory only shows the number of items that have been purchased. You can return to the selection menu through the umbrella logo in the upper left corner of both sections.
